Arrays

- There is an array of 3-tuple, in the form of (a, 1, 5). The first element in the tuple is the id, the second and third elements are both integers, and the third is always larger than or equal to the second. Assume that the array is sorted based on the second element of the tuple. Write a function that breaks each of the 3-tuple into two 2-tuples like (a, 1) and (a, 5), and sort them according to the integer.
E.g. given (a, 1, 5), (b, 2, 4), (c, 7, 8), output (a, 1), (b, 2), (b, 4), (a, 5), (c, 7), (c, 8).


Heaps
- You have k lists of sorted integers. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

For example,
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26]
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20]
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30]

The smallest range here would be [20, 24] as it contains 24 from list 1, 20 from list 2, and 22 from list 3

Graphs
- Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game. 

The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that?
